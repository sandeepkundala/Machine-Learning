# Traffic Classification

## Objective: 
Train a machine learning model to run inference on the routers of data center to select the route for the packets depending on the type of traffic they carry.

## System Under Management:
### For training: 
Any machine with atleast 8GB RAM.
### For inference: 
Data center routers

## Input:
We have trained models with 2 datasets (separately)
1. https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps
2. https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx/Download.html

## Expected Output:
Get a high accuracy model (90%+)

## Models Trained:
We have trained the dataset on Support Vector Machine, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier in Python.

## Future Work:
1. Train the dataset using Neural Networks.
2. Perform similar operation in R, Scala, Hadoop + Apache ML and other cloud platforms to get hands-on experience on different platforms and languages for Machine Learning.
3. Reverse engineer the preprocessing of raw data (from .pcap file to the data considered for Machine Learning.
