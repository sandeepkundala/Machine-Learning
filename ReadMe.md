> # Traffic Classification
>
> ## Objective: 
> Train a machine learning model to run inference on the routers of data center to select the route for the packets depending on the type of traffic they carry.
> 
> ## System Under Management:
> ### For training: 
> Any machine with atleast 8GB RAM.
> ### For inference: 
> Data center routers
> 
> ## Input:
> We have trained models with 2 datasets (separately)
> 1. https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps
> 2. https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx/Download.html
> 
> ## Expected Output:
> Get a high accuracy model (90%+)
>
> ## Models Trained:
> We have trained the dataset on Support Vector Machine, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier in Python.
>
> ## Future Work:
> 1. Train the dataset using Neural Networks.
> 2. Perform similar operation in R, Scala, Hadoop + Apache ML and other cloud platforms to get hands-on experience on different platforms and languages for Machine Learning.
