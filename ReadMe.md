# Traffic Classification

## Objective: 
Train a machine learning model to run inference on the routers of data center to select the route for the packets depending on the type of traffic they carry.

## System Under Management:
### For training: 
Any machine with atleast 8GB RAM.
### For inference: 
Data center routers

## Input:
We have trained models with 2 datasets (separately)
1. https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps
2. https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx/Download.html

## Expected Output:
Get a high accuracy model (90%+)
